# Gradual-Typing-Effect
## Overview
The Gradual Typing Effect is a Python script that simulates a typing effect for any given text. This project is designed to mimic the look of text being typed out slowly, letter by letter, just like in old hacker movies. It's a fun way to showcase programming skills and create an engaging visual effect for text display.

## Features
- Gradual Typing: The script prints each character of the input text one by one, simulating a typing effect.
- Letter-by-Letter Display: For alphabetical characters, each letter is displayed in sequence up to the target character, adding a dramatic effect.
- Handles Non-Alphabetical Characters: Non-alphabetical characters are displayed immediately without the typing effect.

## How It Works
1. Input: The script prompts the user to enter a text phrase.
2. Processing: For each character in the text:
* If it's an alphabetical character, the script gradually types from 'a' to the target letter.
* If it's a non-alphabetical character, it appears instantly.
3. Output: The result is a visually engaging typing effect.
